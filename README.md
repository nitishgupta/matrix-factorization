Matrix-Factorization
====================

This is a code to perform matrix factorization by minimizing the squared euclidean loss error to predict ratings.
The code in its current state reads data from the Amazon Review Data (ref : http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html)
and outputs the RMSE on a held-out test set from the data.
The code is modular and easy to understand. 
To test some other dataset for ratings prediction, one only needs to change the function that reads data.
